# Wikipedia Path Finder

Wikipedia races are a fun game to play with friends. Starting at any Wikipedia page, you must navigate to another specific page by only clicking Wikipedia links.

This seems daunting, especially with end pages that could not be more different (Magneto to Chandragupta Maurya???)

With the Wikipedia Path Finder, simply plug in your start and end pages and find the best path between them in seconds! Easily beat your friends without thinking too hard or cheating.

## Installation and Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies
